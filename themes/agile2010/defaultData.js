The Agile approach is then overlaid to show how the integration of \"traditional\" testing methods, levels and techniques are appropriate and applicable to build quality of the product into the entire life cycle.

It can't. We need to move beyond the classic Iron Triangle measures to an Agile Triangle that focuses on Value, Quality, and Constraints.</p>\n<p>Agile teams are asked to be agile, flexible, and adaptive, but then are told to conform to planned scope, schedule, and cost goals. They are asked to adapt, but inside a very small box. If we are to scale agility to large projects and bring agile values to organizations, then we must change performance measures. To mirror the Agile Manifesto, it's not that scope, schedule, and cost are unimportant, but that value and quality are more important.

In major product companies significant revenue comes from customers of existing legacy products and their support revenues. Hence it isn't surprising that 70-85% of the software development budget is allocated to the operation and enhancement Legacy Code. For many companies their most successful product/application has become their worst enemy. Painfully we have learned that languages, tools, methods and practices we have often been unable to replace or even substantially reduce the entropy of our legacy code. Indeed it is generally accepted today that a major rewrite of any large legacy application has way too much risk and way too little business value to be given serious consideration. We have no choice but to live with and improve our Legacy!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately major Legacy Systems is an area where most in Agile community fear to tread. This is due in part to their lack of experience in these environments. It is also due to their expectations for tool chains and deployment models which are matched to the Agile expectations of incremental OO development and associated tool chains.</p>\n<p>In this talk we discuss how Lean thinking and Agile have been applied to real legacy systems spanning mainframe, military, embedded and multi-vendor integration of legacy and EAP applications. We illustrate by example how organisations can benefit by using Lean and Agile to reduce the entropy (improve Agility) of their legacy systems and hence maximize the value they can get from them.
